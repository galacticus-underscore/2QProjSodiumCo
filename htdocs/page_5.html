       <p>Minecraft is a freeform media with a variety of ways to play. In October of 2015, Minecraft: Story Mode was released, introducing a whole new way that Minecraft can be played: to tell a beautiful story. Since then, Minecraft as a storytelling medium has exploded, with Minecraft Youtubers making roleplay adventures in their worlds like DanTDM and Stampylongnose. They would make videos of “going to the moon,” “defeating supervillains” or “bringing the dead back to life” and other impossible feats in Minecraft through the medium of editing and modifying the game.</p>

       <p>However recently, a new form of Minecraft Roleplay has risen in popularity in the DreamSMP, (SMP meaning Survival Multiplayer) Hermitcraft and the Empires SMP. These servers and many more are multiplayer servers that feature overarching storylines and characters just like any series show or movie would have. You get to watch the story unfold from the point of views of the many streamers broadcasting the story as it unfolds and is improvised live like a theater play and cheer for your favorite character from behind the screen.</p>
