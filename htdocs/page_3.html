          <p>Minecraft being a sandbox-style, open world game, most of the gameplay for noncompetitive players leaves most to the imagination. The game has no definite “end goal,” if not for the optional battle against the Ender Dragon. However, that fight is not at all mandatory in order to “complete” the game. </p>

          <p>With over 150 different types of blocks, complex mechanisms and creatures, players can build the city of their dreams, or just settle down on a simple home and farm. Another thing that has contributed to the popularity of Minecraft amongst regular players are multiplayer servers and worlds. Being able to collaborate with friends or even meet new friends on public servers constantly feeds our need for social interaction and creativity, which is what makes the game so addicting.</p>
